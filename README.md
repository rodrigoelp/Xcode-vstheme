# Visual Studio Theme

Honestly, I can remember if I create this version, if it was based on something else or if I downloaded it from somewhere.
It is my personal configuration.

It should be based on the dark theme used for visual studio code (or visual studio). It offers high contrast and easy to see font.

## Install

<details><summary><b>Xcode (Click to expand)</b></summary><p>

1. Download using the GitHub .zip download option and unzip them.
2. Create the custom themes folder: 
```
~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes/
```
3. Either move `VisualStudio.xccolortheme` or `vscode.xccolortheme` file to this custom themes folder.
4. Download and install [fira code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode). It gives you ligatures and it is amazingly well done.
