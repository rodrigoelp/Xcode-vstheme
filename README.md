# Visual Studio Theme

I cannot honestly remember if I created this version of the theme, if it was based on someone else's work, or if it was downloaded as is from the internet.

I may have tweaked a few things, but nothing special.

This theme is fitting to dark made, aligned to Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code, offering good contrast without it being too harsh on your eyes.

## How to Install

<p>

1. Download using the GitHub .zip download option and unzip them.
2. Create the custom themes folder: 
```
~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes/
```
3. Either move `VisualStudio.xccolortheme` or `vscode.xccolortheme` file to this custom themes folder.
4. Download and install [Fira code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode). It gives you ligatures and it is amazingly well done.
